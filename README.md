I have finished task 0. I heard about Git&GItHug a long long time ago, but it was the very first time to work with it face to face. Great start of course ( at least for me).

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Something I had known already.(ls, mkdir, cd, etc). 
Most part of the course - it was just learning new commands or refreshing old "skills". 
What really DID surprise me - I didn't know that "$" in the beginning of the command line is changeable!!!!!
I will change my "dollar" and keep using new commands.

After the "Git and Github", this task was quiet easy. 
Refreshed my knowledge, became more confident in Pull Requests.
New info - git log's flags and other sweet stuff with it. ( f.i. Grep, shortlog, author).
