I have finished task 0. I heard about Git&GItHug a long long time ago, but it was the very first time to work with it face to face. Great start of course ( at least for me).

## Linux CLI, and HTTP

Something I had known already.(ls, mkdir, cd, etc). 
Most part of the course - it was just learning new commands or refreshing old "skills". 
What really DID surprise me - I didn't know that "$" in the beginning of the command line is changeable!!!!!
I will change my "dollar" and keep using new commands.

After the "Git and Github", this task was quiet easy. 
Refreshed my knowledge, became more confident in Pull Requests.
New info - git log's flags and other sweet stuff with it. ( f.i. Grep, shortlog, author).

Nearly all information was learnt in the spring, so it was a good task to remind 
the basic html and css core. 
As for the new material - it was useful for me to sort out main pillars of css - inheritance and cascade. (their priorities, etc).
Undoubtedly I will use all of that. 

## Responsive Web Design

"what was new to you" - all the first task, because before I only tried to work ( responsive) with a bootstrap. So all moves with tables and other was really interesting and useful!
"what surprised you" - that I passed 21/24 flexbox froggy before (this very year)
"what you intend to use in future" - % instead of px. Flex. And i like the way to make my table responsive. Easy and fast)
